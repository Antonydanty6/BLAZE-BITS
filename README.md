# ✨ The Useless Button

A simple, fun, and entirely useless single-page web application. Click the button and see what pointless thing happens next!

## 🚀 Features

This project demonstrates a variety of simple web interactions. Every click on the button triggers a random action:

* **🎨 Color Change:** Randomly changes the background color of the page.
* **🧠 Useless Fact:** Displays a random, useless fact.
* **🔊 Random Sound:** Plays a delightful (or annoying) random note.
* **💨 Runaway Button:** Moves the button to a random position on the screen.
* **📝 Text Swap:** Changes the text on the button itself.
* **❓ Does Nothing:** Sometimes, the most useless action is no action at all.
* **🤏 Shrink:** Briefly shrinks the button before it returns to its normal size.
* **📈 Click Counter:** Keeps track of how many times you've clicked the button.
